# Visualizing and understanding the posterior

There are two groups of statistics and visualizations to think about:

* How well did the model sample

* What does the model think about the world?

---

# A few common things we can calculate 
### a verbal introduction

* $y_{rep}$ => "simulated data"; observations from the model which (ideally) resemble real data
* $\hat{y}$ => Estimate of what the sample expectation should be
* $\hat{R}$ => how well did our chains mix
* $\hat{k}$ (aka Pareto k) => Predictive performance for every point. How much would posterior change without this point?
