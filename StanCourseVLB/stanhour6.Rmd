### Interpreting the Statistical Results...


...by the data that your model generates. 


In particular, pretend each realization is something that actually occurred, does it make sense? Generate a population/group/system, where does your model fail?

### Challenge

Make your model stand out by inserting **at least 1** structure that is specific to your system. 

--

Yes, even with a GLM. Even a linear model.
